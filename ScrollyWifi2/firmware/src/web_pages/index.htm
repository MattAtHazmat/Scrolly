<h1>Welcome!</h1>

<p></p>You are currently connected to:</p>

<table style="padding-left: 10px;">
<tr><td><b>SSID:</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>~ssid~</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Security Type:</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>~currPrivacy~</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>WLAN Type:</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>~currWLAN~</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>IP Address:</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>~ipaddr~</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>Module FW Version:</b></td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>~fwver~</td></tr>
</table>

<p>On the right you'll see the current status of the demo board.  For a quick
example, click the LEDs to toggle the lights on the board.  Press the push
button and you'll see the Button Status update immediately.  This examples uses AJAX
techniques to provide real-time feedback.</p>

<p>There are three menu items on the left hand side.  The first is the current page you see,
which shows the status of the LEDs and push button.</p>

<p>The second menu item (Wi-Fi G Demo), will display a page with information about the 802.11b/g RF Transceiver Module being used for this demo.</p>

<p>The third menu item (Network Configuration), will display a page that will allow you to scan
for nearby networks, see them, and then connect to another network.  After the attempt is made
to connect to the new network, you will have to transition your wireless PC, laptop, or handheld
wireless device to this new network in order to see that the device has indeed changed networks.</p>

<h2>Browser-based Device Configuration</h2>

<p>This showcases how to configure and program an embedded Wi-Fi device that does not
have a natural keyboard and screen.  By using the internal web server that accompanies
the Microchip TCP/IP stack, end-users can use their browser as a conduit for programming
the device with the correct network parameters.</p>

<p></p>For a wireless network, an end-user would need to have knowledge of at least the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>SSID</li>
<li>Security Type (None, WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA-AUTO, WPS)</li>
<li>Security Key</li>
</ul>

<p>As pioneered by most modern operating systems, the application also has the ability to scan for 
all networks in the vicinity of the device, and display them to the user.  The user will
also be given additional information about the network such as whether security is enabled
or how far away the other network is.  Users are also given the opportunity to enter all the
network information manually, which is required when trying to connect to a network with a 
hidden SSID.</p>
